### ⚡ Who Am I?

Hey, I’m `codebyzeun` — an engineer, researcher, and unapologetic experimenter.  
I don’t just build code — I build **systems that react**, systems that **understand**, and systems that **speak** back.  

By the time you're reading this, there’s a good chance my AI is already analyzing a camera feed,  
generating live insights, and wondering why the world doesn't move faster.

> 💬 “Why wait for the future, when you can generate it?”

### 🔮 What I'm Building

#### 🧠 Proxy AI
> Proxy AI is a real-time AI system that fuses computer vision and language models  
> to turn live video into context-aware narration, analysis, and response.

- 📸 **Input**: Live camera streams or frames
- 🧠 **Process**: YOLOv8 + Transformer-based NLP
- 🗣️ **Output**: Natural language responses, summaries, and actions
- 🧰 Built with: Python, OpenCV, FastAPI, PyTorch, LangChain, and a reckless amount of caffeine

### 👁️‍🗨️ The Philosophy

I believe in:
- 🧠 AI that **assists**, not replaces
- 🧊 Open-source systems with transparent logic
- 🔓 Knowledge as a **right**, not a product
- 🧪 Messy experimentation > perfect plans

I don't believe in:
- Gatekeeping
- Closed-box black magic AI
- Waiting until someone else builds it

### 🎤 Final Thought

> “I'm not trying to change the world.  
> I'm just teaching machines how to **see** it clearly.”

Thanks for stopping by. Keep watching.  
This is just the beginning.
